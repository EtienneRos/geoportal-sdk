### BREAKING CHANGES

* **gis:** ellipsoidSizes from Coordinates.js is no longer a
function but an object.
* **core:** change view.notifyChange signature and semantics
* **Core:** Before this change, `view.addLayer` was throwing some errors directly in
some cases, and rejecting the promise in others. This replaces the
former for the latter in all cases. If you relied on a try/catch block
surrounding `view.addLayer` to catch some undocumented errors, you need
to move your error handling code to your promise rejection handler.
* **core:** this modify the signature of all picking functions.
* the signature of Fetcher.texture has changed, and only
return a promise now, instead of an object containing the texture and
the promise.
* **core:** a Provider needs to return a Promise every time after
calling its executeCommand function.
* **vector:** feature collection are not merged anymore
* **vector:** GeoJSON2Feature now returns a Promise
* **core:** c3DEngine.renderViewTobuffer has been renamed renderViewToBuffer
and has a new signature.
* - `layer.options.mimetype` is removed in favor of `layer.format`.
- `WFS_Provider`: format should now be a proper mimetype. So `json`
  becomes `application/json`, `geojson` becomes `application/geojson`.
* **core:** KML_Provider and BuildingBox_Provider have been
removed, as well as getPointOrder from WFS_Provider.
